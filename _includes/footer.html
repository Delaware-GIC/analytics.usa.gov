          <h3>About this Site</h3>
<p>This data provides a window into how people are interacting with the State of Delaware government online. The data comes from Google Analytics accounts for State of Delaware government agencies. This data helps government agencies understand how people find, access, and use government services online. This does not track individuals, and anonymizes the IP addresses of visitors. </p>

<p>Not every State of Delaware website is represented in this data. We plan to expand the data made available here, and will be adding new domains from agencies and Delaware municipalities that opt-in. To add your site, please <a href="https://gic.delaware.gov/contact-government-information-center/">contact us</a>.</p>
